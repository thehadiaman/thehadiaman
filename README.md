## About Me

I'm just your friendly neighborhood coder, trying to make the world a better place—one line of code at a time. You'll often find me at my computer, banging my head on the keyboard while pretending to know what I'm doing, then you realize I know what I am doing, isn't it crazy.

## Skills

I like to think I'm pretty good at some things. Here are a few of my superpowers:

- 💡 I can learn anything.
- 💾 Storing knowledge in my head... until I need it.
- 🚀 Debugging the un-debuggable.
- 🌟 Creating code that's so efficient.

## Current Projects

I'm constantly working on exciting projects, like:

- 🤖 Building a robot to fetch my snacks, naa I am kidding.
- 📚 I am creating a SSO for my future projects, possibly for **my company**.
