## About Me

I'm just your friendly neighborhood coder, trying to make the world a better place—one line of code at a time. You'll often find me at my computer, banging my head on the keyboard while pretending to know what I'm doing, then you realize I know what I am doing, isn't it crazy.

## Skills

I like to think I'm pretty good at some things. Here are a few of my superpowers:

- 💾 Storing knowledge in my head... until I need it.

## Current Projects

I'm constantly working on exciting projects, like:
